          >As a membrane separating circulating blood and brain extracellular
          fluid, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the protection layer that
          blocks most foreign drugs. Thus the ability of a drug to penetrate the
          barrier to deliver to the site of action forms a crucial challenge in
          development of drugs for central nervous system From

          >CYP3A4 is an important enzyme in the body, mainly found in the liver
          and in the intestine. It oxidizes small foreign organic molecules
          (xenobiotics), such as toxins or drugs, so that they can be removed
          from the body.</font

          Poor water solubility could lead to slow drug absorptions, inadequate
          bioavailablity and even induce toxicity. More than 40% of new chemical
          entities are not soluble.</font
