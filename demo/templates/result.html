      <h4>Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability: {{ result_bbb }}</h4>
      <font size="2"
        >As a membrane separating circulating blood and brain extracellular
        fluid, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the protection layer that blocks
        most foreign drugs. Thus the ability of a drug to penetrate the barrier
        to deliver to the site of action forms a crucial challenge in
        development of drugs for central nervous system From MoleculeNet.</font

      <h4>CYP3A4: {{ result_cyp }}</h4>
      <font size="2"
        >CYP3A4 is an important enzyme in the body, mainly found in the liver
        and in the intestine. It oxidizes small foreign organic molecules
        (xenobiotics), such as toxins or drugs, so that they can be removed from
        the body.</font
      >
      <h4>Solubility: {{ result_sol }}</h4>
      <font size="2"
        >Aqeuous solubility measures a drug's ability to dissolve in water. Poor
        water solubility could lead to slow drug absorptions, inadequate
        bioavailablity and even induce toxicity. More than 40% of new chemical
        entities are not soluble.</font
      >
      <h4>Clearance: {{ result_clr }}</h4>
      <font size="2"
        >Drug clearance is defined as the volume of plasma cleared of a drug
        over a specified time period and it measures the rate at which the
        active drug is removed from the body.</font
